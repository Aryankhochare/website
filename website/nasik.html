      <b>  Date: Saturday, 29 February 2020</b> <br>
        The IEEE Student Branch of Don Bosco College of Engineering (Fatorda, Goa) had organised an educational tour for its members to Nashik, Maharashtra. We visited Sula Vineyards to get acquainted to the automation technology used. The guide toured us through the entire process involved in making wine & process control instrumentation involved in the same. He began with informing us about the history of how Sula was founded. He then explained the ageing process involved in making a good wine and the temperatures they have to maintain in the special place called barrel room as the temperature and weather of Nashik is not as same as the ideal weather required like weather of California. All of their machinery and barrels have been imported from France and California. The barrels are made from a special wood called Oak wood. Free time was provided to the group to visit the beautiful location. Overall the visit was really good and gave us an insight of the difficulties involved in making a good wine due to the temperature differences. <br>

  No matter how much students learn during an Educational trip, their favourite memories may be based on their enjoyment of the day. Getting away from the everyday atmosphere of the classroom gives students an opportunity to spend time with each other in a new environment.
  On day 2 of our educational tour, 1st March 2020, various fun activities were planned for all. Everyone was excited and highly enthusiastic. Everyone was informed to gather at Nehru Garden. The main purpose of having such event was to develop the bond & let the communication happen between all the IEEE Student members as all were from different classes & departments. Students had fun playing various games, technical interactions & challenges involved in making IEEE student branch to function properly. It was indeed a great day for students as many of them knew most of them than the time when tour began.

The IEEE members travelled to Sarda Farms  which is a 100% pure, organic dairy farm. It is an 11-acre farm that houses 1250 cows. The milk farm is completely mechanised- the whole process from milking the cows to aggregation and packaging is fully automated, with minimum to zero human intervention. The visit began at the cow shed where each cow has a tag on its ear that gives the farm officials its information. Mr. Purbhaji Kadam, Sarda Farms member, explained in detail about the RFID technology. A RFID tag is placed around the neck of every cow. This tag is connected to various sensors placed in the shed and measures the temperature of the cow. These tags send signals to various foggers placed in the shed which give a light shower when the cow’s temperature crosses 30 degree Celsius and humidity crosses 50.
Then, the group was shown the food storage which can store fodder worth of up to 1 month. The workers of the farm have prepared a nutrition chart and the cows are fed groundnut cakes, ground corn of up to 40 kg as per their individual requirement. After this, students were mentioned that milking of the cows takes place thrice a day. The difference between traditional farms and Sarda Farms is that traditionally cows are milked by hand, but at Sarda Farms, milking is done by automated machines. This milk is then transported to cooling tanks by pipes and cooled to 4 degree Celsius, which is then sent for processing to the processing plant. A quick explanation of the software- Delpro Farm Manager was given. This software stores and displays every minute detail of each cow including their family history, medical reports, lactation, etc with automatic updates in the parameters with the use of IoT(Internet of Things). A special feature of Sarda Farms that was mentioned was that this farm works entirely on green energy. They produce electricity from biogas which is received from cow dung. Hence, they do not have to pay electricity bills but instead get biogas credit for saving as well as producing energy.
Every attendee was delighted to visit and know about Sarda Farms since cows here are treated with equal, if not more, love and respect as that of humans. It was also very exciting to learn about the technology which is at par with international standards.

          The field visit began with the instructor reciting all the precautions and rules that must be maintained in the plant, the students were escorted to the TSC room where a short PowerPoint presentation was shown to them. The thermal power station has rated capacity of 630 MW and has 3 units of 210 MW each. It uses a coal-fired boiler to produce steam for power generation. Nashik Thermal Power
          Station has an installed capacity of 140*2+210*3=910 MW. The first unit was commissioned in 1970. The cost of unit including civil works was Rs. 56.5 crores and the second unit also commissioned with the same cost under the first stage. The second stage consists of three units of 210 MW each was commissioned in the later years. The power station campus includes self-contained township with all amenities. The entire land consists of 474 hectares. The power plant has got ISO Certification on April 2002. The coal is supplied from the western coal field, while the water from the Gangapur waters.
          Shaktiman is a scrap metal sculpture built by NTPS intended to be a symbol of visionary resourcefulness. It weighs 27 tonnes, is 17 metres tall, and is in the Guinness Book of Records. It is meant to stand as a symbol of innovative idea in word and spirit, inspiring visitors that wealth from waste can be a reality. After the PowerPoint presentation, the students were shown the various phases of the plant and the functionalities. Students acquired practical knowledge, outline idea and first-hand concepts of how actually power is generated, transmitted and distributed in a thermal power plant. Students got familiar with units, sub-units and machineries involved in thermal power generation stations, like, Pulveriser, Boiler, Transformers, Cooling Tower and their actual roles on the power generation.

              The educational tour was a great benefit for the IEEE student members to understand about the various concepts of Process control Instrumentation at Sula Automation, Generation of Electricity at Thermal Power station & RFID technology with IoT interface at Sarda Farms. Apart from the knowledge, such expeditions provide an opportunity to the students for the concern and involvement with their peer cluster. Interacting with locals and other students during this tour helped them to develop amazing social skills & networks, especially with the industry people. All the IEEE Student members have really worked hard to make this happen & deserve whole hearted appreciation.
